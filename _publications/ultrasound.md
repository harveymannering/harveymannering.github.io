title: Towards Realistic Ultrasound Fetal Brain Imaging Synthesis
year: 2022
excerpt: The results of this work illustrate the potential of GAN-based and diffusion-based methods to synthesise realistic high-resolution ultrasound images, leading to future work with other fetal brain planes, anatomies, devices and the need of a pool of experts to evaluate synthesised images.
